# Behavioral Cloning in Udacity Simulator
This repo documents my work on training a CNN model for self-driving car. I use the simulator developed by Udacity for car driving. I deployed fastai framework for model training. I experimented with different models, the first two being pretrained ResNet34 and the CNN proposed by NVIDIA in literature.
